## Specs
| Resource | Website | Utility | Description |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- | :----------- |
| **BeepBox** | https://www.beepbox.co/ | 8-Bit Chiptune Creator | This website allows users with little to no experience in sound design to create Chiptunes and easily turn them into an audio file. For more functionality there is also a project out there for a Modded BeepBox that adds much more utility.|
| **MusicLab** | https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/ | Music Creator | This website has a lot of sound creation gadgets but the Song Maker allows you to make an audio file.  It is the most basic of website on here but for quick tunes it can create a solid rythme. This seems mostly like a childrens museum piece.|
| **Soundation** | https://soundation.com/ | Music Creator | A rather fleshed out music creation website.  While they boast some community aspects the key point is that you are able to record and edit moderately high quality music.  This website takes a bit more knowledge but can be learned rather easily. |
| **Photopea** | https://www.photopea.com/ | Photoshop Style Editing | This website allows users to utilize many photo editing tools for free.  It has many of the tools you might find in Photoshop and it operates without the need to install anything. |
| **BeFunky** | https://www.befunky.com/ | Photo Editor | Simple photo editor that also has a upgraded subscription but doenst really add much. |
| **Piskel** | https://www.piskelapp.com/ | 8-Bit Sprite Creation | While this website also has an offline version, you are able to utilize all the tools on their website as well.  It will allow you to create Sprite Maps and 8-Bit animation in a very simple editor. |
| **Phaser 3** | https://phaser.io/phaser3 | Game Framework | A framework specifically designed for HTML games using Javascript.  Mostly using canvas this framework boasts a lot of built in game creation functionality if you can learn it. |
